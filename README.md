# sdi_scatters
A command line interface for generating scatter plots showing the relationship between Global Burden of Disease model results and Sociodemographic Index.

# about
This collection of scripts was created so modelers could create scatter plots of their model results against the Socio-demographic Indices of all country level locations.

Users were able to run this program in the main research environment provided by Central Computation.

A user had to navigate to the folder where this code lived and call the sdi_scatters.py module with the appropriate command line arguments. This would then create and save a .pdf of the scatter plot to whichever directory the user specified on calling the program.
